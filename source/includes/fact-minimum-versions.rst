Starting in version 1.2, ``mongosync`` can sync between clusters running 
some older (pre-6.0) releases of MongoDB Server. This feature requires
additional preparation and configuration in pre-6.0 releases.

Also, ``mongosync`` can perform a cross version migration
from a lower major version source cluster to a higher major version
destination cluster, up to two major versions ahead. For example,
migrate from 6.0 to 7.0. This also requires additional
preparation.

If you would like to migrate pre-6.0 versions of MongoDB Server using
``mongosync``, or perform a cross version migration, please `contact
<https://mongodb.com/contact>`__ your account team to inquire about
Professional Services.

Starting in version 1.2, ``mongosync`` can sync between clusters running 
some older (pre-6.0) releases of MongoDB Server. This feature requires
additional preparation and configuration in pre-6.0 releases.

Also, ``mongosync`` can perform a cross version migration from a pre-6.0
MongoDB Server to a later version, which also requires additional
preparation. 

If you would like to migrate pre-6.0 versions of MongoDB Server using
``mongosync``, or perform a cross version migration, please `contact
<https://mongodb.com/contact>`__ your account team to inquire about
Professional Services.

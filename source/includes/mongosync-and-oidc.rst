Starting in 1.8.1, you can use ``mongosync`` with Workload Identity
Federation to authenticate with and connect to MongoDB clusters running
on Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud Platform. Workload Identity
Federation uses OpenID Connect (OIDC). OIDC is a protocol that allows
users to authenticate credentials with an external identity provider.

Starting in 1.8.1, you can use ``mongosync`` with Workload Identity
Federation to connect to MongoDB clusters running on Microsoft Azure and
Google Cloud Platform. Workload Identity Federation uses OpenID Connect
(OIDC). OIDC is a protocol that allows users to authenticate using an
external identity provider.

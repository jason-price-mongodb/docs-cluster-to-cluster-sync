Starting in 1.7.0, you can set a name for a data migration. For example,
you can set a migration name to differentiate multiple migrations that
send data to the same destination cluster. To set a data migration name,
see:

- :setting:`migrationName` configuration file setting
- :option:`migrationName` command line option

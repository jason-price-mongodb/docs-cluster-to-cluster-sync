*Default*: ``3``

Sets the cluster workload level and controls the data synchronization
speed between the source and destination clusters.

The highest setting of ``4`` causes maximum cluster workload and the
fastest data synchronization. The lowest setting of ``1`` causes minimum
cluster workload and the slowest data synchronization.

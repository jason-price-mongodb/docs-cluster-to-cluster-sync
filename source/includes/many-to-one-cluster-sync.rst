Starting in 1.7.0, ``mongosync`` can migrate data from many clusters to
the same cluster.

You can also set a name for a data migration. For example, you
can set a migration name to differentiate multiple migrations that send
data to the same destination cluster. For details, see:

- :setting:`migrationName` configuration file setting
- :option:`migrationName` command line option

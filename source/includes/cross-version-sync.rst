Starting in 1.7.0, ``mongosync`` can synchronize data between clusters
running different MongoDB major server versions. For example,
synchronize clusters running MongoDB 6.0 and 7.0.

Cross version migration requires additional preparation and
configuration when migrating from a pre-6.0 release. If you would like
to migrate pre-6.0 versions of the MongoDB Server using ``mongosync``,
or perform a cross version migration, please `contact
<https://mongodb.com/contact>`__ your account team to inquire about
Professional Services.

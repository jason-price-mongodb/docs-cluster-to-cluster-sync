Starting in 1.7.0, ``mongosync`` can perform a cross version migration
from a lower major version source cluster to a higher major version
destination cluster, up to two major versions ahead. For example,
synchronize clusters running MongoDB 6.0 and 7.0.

Cross version migration requires additional preparation and
configuration when migrating from a pre-6.0 release. If you would like
to migrate pre-6.0 versions of the MongoDB Server using ``mongosync``,
or perform a cross version migration, please `contact
<https://mongodb.com/contact>`__ your account team to inquire about
Professional Services.

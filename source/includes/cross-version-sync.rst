Starting in 1.7.0, ``mongosync`` can perform a cross version migration
from a lower major version source cluster to a higher major version
destination cluster. You can migrate up to two major versions ahead. For
example, you can synchronize a cluster running MongoDB 6.0 with a
cluster running 7.0.

Cross version migration requires additional preparation and
configuration when migrating from a pre-6.0 release. If you would like
to migrate pre-6.0 versions of the MongoDB Server using ``mongosync``,
or perform a cross version migration, please `contact
<https://mongodb.com/contact>`__ your account team to inquire about
Professional Services.
